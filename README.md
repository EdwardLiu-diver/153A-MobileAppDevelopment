# F1 Gallery app


## Introduction
Are you a fan of formula one racing? F1 is the highest class of international auto racing for single-seater formula cars. With this app, you can learn about 10 F1 constructors and 20 drivers, choose your favorite driver or team, and cheer for the championship race throughout the year. At the same time, the APP has a certain schedule attribute, it will remind the next game time and location on the home page. In the future work, I want to add the circuit informations and more background stories about the drivers and constructors.
